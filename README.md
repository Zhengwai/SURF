# SURF
A data picking tool I developed used in the Physics Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program.
After loading an nd-array image, by clicking the particles their locations will be recorded. It also supports undo, redo, save as, and resizing.
There are two versions done with tkinter and Qt respectively.
